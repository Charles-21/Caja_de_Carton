**_Template mamalón de Emi para gente que no hizo respaldo_**

Dear Customer,

Thank you for reaching out and I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Here’s what happened and how we can resolve it:

📌 What Occurred

According to our billing and instance lifecycle policy:

When a pay‑as‑you‑go ECS instance fails to meet payment requests for 15 days after suspension, it is automatically released, and all associated data (disks, snapshots, configurations) is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered

That´s why you're unable to restart or access your instance

⚙ Recovery Options

If You Have Backups/Snapshots:

You can restore a new ECS instance from any existing snapshots or Cloud Backups

[https://docs-aliyun.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/pdf/ecs-Pricing-intl-en-2017-06-19.pdf](https://docs-aliyun.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/pdf/ecs-Pricing-intl-en-2017-06-19.pdf)

Use the Cloud Backup console → select your backup → choose “Clone” or “Restore” to create a fresh instance.

If No Backups Are Available

-You’ll need to recreate the instance from scratch, reinstall software, and redeploy your application.

-While inconvenient, this will restore your workspace with a clean slate.

🔧 How to Prevent This in Future

Maintain sufficient account balance or use auto-renewal/subscription billing so services aren’t suspended due to non-payment

Enable Cloud Backup or schedule snapshots regularly to ensure recoverability

✅ Next Steps for You

1.Check for existing snapshots or backups in your ECS or Cloud Backup console.

2. If backups exist, restore your instance from them.

3. If not, create a fresh ECS instance and set it up again.

4.Consider enabling auto-renewal and a backup strategy.

If you have any other question just ask me and I will answer you in the fastest way for you

Remember at the finish of the ticket select solved and you'll have the opportunity to evaluate our service,

Please leave us a good and solved review.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best Regards,
