Practica ésto para que no te tuerzan los chinos


**Greetings**

Good morning, everyone. It’s a pleasure to meet you — I hope you’re all doing well.  _(insert friendly smile or tone here)_

I’ll go ahead and share my screen so you can follow along with the presentation.  
Let me know once you can see it — could someone please confirm?

My name is Charles, and as you may already know, I have been working here for the past two months.

Today I’m excited to share with you a brief overview of what I have done during my probation period, what I’ve learned, and how I intend to keep contributing to our team’s growth.

**Self introduction**

As I said before, my name is Charles, and I belong to the Axolotl team, based in Mexico City.

I completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics and Mathematics.
Previously, I worked as a **teaching assistant** at my university, delivering lessons in **astrophysics** and **advanced mathematics**. I also worked as a **metrology apprentice** in a **calibration lab specialized in scales and balances**, where I learned the importance of precision and rigorous standards.
 
I’ve also gained valuable experience in **customer service**, having worked in my family’s coffee shop since I was a child. That role helped me develop empathy, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility toward others.
 
On the technical side, I’m confident working with programming languages such as **Python**, **Julia**, and **Fortran**, and I’m very comfortable using **Linux environments**, especially Debian and Fedora.
 
I’ve also worked with **data analysis and business tools**, including **Power BI**, **Power Apps**, and **Power Automate**, developing internal tools and automated workflows.
 
In addition, I have experience in **scientific computing**, particularly in **numerical simulations** and **differential equation modeling**, which has helped me build efficient, data-driven solutions.

I believe this combination of **scientific training**, **technical skills**, and **hands-on customer experience** allows me to approach problems with both a logical mindset and a strong focus on people’s needs.

**Personal Action Plan about performance improvement or maintenance in future**

In this section, I’d like to share some of the actions I plan to take in order to improve and maintain high performance moving forward.

First, I want to focus on refining my communication skills — especially in writing — to ensure that customers feel truly supported, understood, and valued. I will be studying what makes a message not only informative, but also empathetic and reassuring.

I also intend to go deeper into the official documentation, and review past tickets to identify areas where I can improve my approach or better understand cases I haven’t encountered yet.

Another key point is staying in close contact with my supervisor to understand the team’s priorities, and to be available where I’m most needed. For example, if data shows a pattern of high ticket volume at specific times, I’d be willing to adjust my schedule accordingly to better support the team.

Finally, I’ll stay flexible and open to feedback, always ready to adapt to any new challenges or improvements the team needs.
