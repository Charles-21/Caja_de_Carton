SCRIPT FOR THE DEFENSE

**Greetings**

Good morning, everyone. It’s a pleasure to meet you — I hope you’re all doing well.  _(insert friendly smile or tone here)_

I’ll go ahead and share my screen so you can follow along with the presentation.  
Let me know once you can see it — could someone please confirm?

My name is Charles, and as you may already know, I have been working here for the past two months.

Today I’m excited to share with you a brief overview of what I have done during my probation period, what I’ve learned, and how I intend to keep contributing to our team’s growth.

**Self introduction**

As I said before, my name is Charles, and I belong to the Axolotl team, based in Mexico City.

I completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics and Mathematics.
Previously, I worked as a **teaching assistant** at my university, delivering lessons in **astrophysics** and **advanced mathematics**. I also worked as a **metrology apprentice** in a **calibration lab specialized in scales and balances**, where I learned the importance of precision and rigorous standards.
 
I’ve also gained valuable experience in **customer service**, having worked in my family’s coffee shop since I was a child. That role helped me develop empathy, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility toward others.
 
On the technical side, I’m confident working with programming languages such as **Python**, **Julia**, and **Fortran**, and I’m very comfortable using **Linux environments**, especially Debian and Fedora.
 
I’ve also worked with **data analysis and business tools**, including **Power BI**, **Power Apps**, and **Power Automate**, developing internal tools and automated workflows.
 
In addition, I have experience in **scientific computing**, particularly in **numerical simulations** and **differential equation modeling**, which has helped me build efficient, data-driven solutions.

I believe this combination of **scientific training**, **technical skills**, and **hands-on customer experience** allows me to approach problems with both a logical mindset and a strong focus on people’s needs.

**Personal Action Plan about performance improvement or maintenance in future**

In this section, I’d like to share some of the actions I plan to take in order to improve and maintain high performance moving forward.

First, I want to focus on refining my communication skills — especially in writing — to ensure that customers feel truly supported, understood, and valued. I will be studying what makes a message not only informative, but also empathetic and reassuring.

I also intend to go deeper into the official documentation, and review past tickets to identify areas where I can improve my approach or better understand cases I haven’t encountered yet.

Another key point is staying in close contact with my supervisor to understand the team’s priorities, and to be available where I’m most needed. For example, if data shows a pattern of high ticket volume at specific times, I’d be willing to adjust my schedule accordingly to better support the team.

Finally, I’ll stay flexible and open to feedback, always ready to adapt to any new challenges or improvements the team needs.

**Personal KPI result during the probation period**

Now I’d like to show you the **key performance indicators** from my probation period.

As you can see, during these two months, my **Satisfaction Rate** was **87.5%**, which is slightly higher than the team average of 84.38%.

My **Days to Solve (DTS)** was **0.48** (Zero point four eight), compared to the team average of 0.56. This means I’ve been able to resolve cases relatively quickly.

In terms of **First Day Resolution (FDR)**, I reached **81.58%** (eighty-one point five eight percent), also slightly above the team average. This suggests that most of the time, I’ve been able to solve issues effectively on the first try.

Even though the **ticket volume** I have handled is lower — which is expected, since I’m still new — I’ve focused on quality, precision, and learning as much as possible with every case.

I also kept my number of **bad satisfaction tickets** to just one, and I’ll continue working to reduce that even further.

Overall, I believe these numbers reflect a positive start and a strong foundation to keep growing and contributing to the team.

In the following graphs, I’m showing three key performance indicators that cover the three months of my probation period.

As you can see, my **Satisfaction Rate** has increased steadily and has remained at **100%** during the past 10 days of July.

My **DTS** — Day to Solve — has shown a significant decrease, which reflects improved efficiency in handling cases.

Likewise, my **FDR**, or First-time Delivery Rate, has also improved over time, showing better issue resolution on the first reply.

These trends give me confidence that I’m on the right path, and I’ll keep working to maintain and improve these results moving forward.

**Two Sample Ticket with the most impressive progress**

This first ticket was assigned to me the day after it was created, so my role was to follow up and assist the customer accordingly.

I kindly requested the ID of the affected server and informed the customer that I would escalate the case to the appropriate team who could best handle the issue.

Once the customer provided the required information, I let them know we would keep them updated as soon as we had any progress.

Shortly after that, the customer closed the ticket with a positive review and left the following comments:

- Comprehensive Product Functionality
- User-friendly Product Interface
- Good Service Attitude
- Fast Service Efficiency
- Strong Service Professionalism

In this second case, the customer wanted to know if there was any way to recover their data, since their **Simple Application Server** subscription had already expired.

I took the time to research the official documentation and found the relevant details regarding this situation.  
Then I explained the scenario to the customer in a clear and friendly way, helping them understand what had happened and what options were available. I also provided the appropriate documentation for their reference.

Shortly after, the customer expressed their gratitude, closed the ticket, and left a positive review with the tag:

- _“User-friendly Product Interface.”_

From both of these experiences, I learned the importance of providing accurate, well-sourced information, and of choosing the right words to make the customer feel heard, supported, and well attended.

That concludes my presentation. Thank you very much for your time. I’m open to any suggestions or questions you might have.
